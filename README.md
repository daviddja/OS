1 Zadaca - This C program simulates a background processing service that reads a status from a file, processes data, updates the status, and reacts to Unix signals like SIGINT, SIGTERM, and SIGUSR1.

2 Zadaca - This project demonstrates Dekker's algorithm for mutual exclusion using two processes that share memory. Each process tries to enter a critical section multiple times while ensuring that only one process is inside the critical section at a time.

3 Zadaca - This project simulates multiple threads (representing users) attempting to reserve shared tables concurrently. It uses Lamport's Bakery Algorithm to ensure mutual exclusion when accessing shared resources (tables).

4 Zadaca -  This program simulates a carousel (amusement ride) using POSIX semaphores and multiple processes. The simulation includes a carousel with a fixed number of seats and multiple visitors trying to take a ride.

5 Zadaca - This program implements the  Dining Philosophers Problem using POSIX threads (pthreads) and semaphores in C. It simulates five philosophers sitting around a table, each alternating between thinking and eating. The challenge is to manage access to shared resources (forks) in a way that avoids deadlock and starvation.
